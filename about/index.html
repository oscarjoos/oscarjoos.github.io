  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p> My name is Oscar Joos. I have a degree in Finance & Business Administration from Umeå University. I am an avid investor and recently I have also become interested in programming, and that is how this website came to be.  
I invite you to jump around my page and have a look at different sections to get to learn more about me. This page is most likely going to change and improve over time as my programming skills improve, and as I think of new things to put on the website.
I will attach some classical music below, for you to listen to as you browse my page. </p> <br>

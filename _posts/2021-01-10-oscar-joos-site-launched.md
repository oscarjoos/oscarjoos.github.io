Finally got around to putting a website together with my new programming skills. I got some inspiration from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> jmcglone.com/github <br>

I am excited to start star t is programming journey, I am happy that this option to host the website for free exists while I get this up and running.
